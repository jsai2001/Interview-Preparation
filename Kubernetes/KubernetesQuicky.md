# Kubernetes Interview Preparation

## Kubernetes Basics

### What is Kubernetes, and why is it used?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized apps. It’s used for scalability, resilience, and portability—handling tasks like load balancing, self-healing, and resource optimization across any environment.

### What problems does Kubernetes solve in container orchestration?
It automates deployment, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing; manages resources, service discovery, and configs; and coordinates containers across multiple hosts for high availability.

### Explain the difference between Docker and Kubernetes.
Docker builds and runs containers on one host. Kubernetes orchestrates many containers across a cluster, adding scaling, scheduling, and networking.

### What is a container, and how does Kubernetes manage containers?
A container is a lightweight, isolated app package with dependencies. Kubernetes groups them into Pods, schedules them on nodes, manages their lifecycle, and handles networking and scaling.

### What are the key components of Kubernetes architecture?
- **Control Plane**: kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager.
- **Worker Nodes**: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime (e.g., Docker).

### What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
The smallest unit—runs one or more containers sharing network (IP) and storage. Ephemeral and managed by controllers.

### How does Kubernetes differ from traditional virtualization?
Containers share the host OS, making them lighter and faster than VMs, which run full guest OSes. Kubernetes optimizes this for scale.

### What is the role of a Kubernetes cluster?
A group of nodes running containers, managed as one system for deployment, scaling, and fault tolerance.

### What is the difference between a node and a cluster in Kubernetes?
- **Node**: Single machine (master or worker).
- **Cluster**: All nodes working together under a control plane.

### What is a control plane in Kubernetes, and what does it consist of?
The brain of the cluster—manages state and scheduling. Includes kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Explain the role of the kube-apiserver.
Central hub—exposes the API, handles requests, authenticates/authorizes, and updates etcd.

### What does the kube-scheduler do?
Places Pods on nodes based on resources, policies, and constraints.

### What is the purpose of the kube-controller-manager?
Runs controllers to keep cluster state (e.g., replicas, nodes) as desired.

### What is etcd, and why is it important in Kubernetes?
Distributed store for cluster state—critical for consistency and control plane operations.

### How does the kubelet work on a worker node?
Node agent—starts/stops containers, ensures Pods run, and reports to the control plane.

### What is the role of kube-proxy in Kubernetes?
Manages networking—sets up rules for Service IPs and load balances traffic to Pods.

### Explain the difference between master nodes and worker nodes.
- **Master**: Runs control plane (manages cluster).
- **Worker**: Runs Pods (executes workloads).

### What is the Cloud Controller Manager, and when is it used?
Links Kubernetes to cloud APIs for nodes, load balancers, and storage—used in cloud-hosted clusters.

### How does Kubernetes ensure high availability of the control plane?
Multiple master nodes, replicated etcd, leader election, and load-balanced API servers.

### What is a Namespace in Kubernetes, and how is it used?
Logical partition—isolates resources, scopes access, and limits quotas for teams or projects.

## Pods and Workloads

### How do you create a Pod in Kubernetes?
**YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: my-pod
spec:
    containers:
    - name: my-container
        image: nginx
```
Apply: `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`  
Or command: `kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never`

### What is the difference between a Pod and a Deployment?
- **Pod**: Single instance of containers.
- **Deployment**: Manages Pods with replicas, updates, and self-healing.

### What is a ReplicaSet, and how does it relate to a Deployment?
Ensures a set number of Pods run. Deployment creates and updates ReplicaSets for rollouts.

### Explain the lifecycle of a Pod.
`Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → (Unknown if lost)`. Managed by init containers and probes.

### What are labels and selectors in Kubernetes, and how are they used?
- **Labels**: Key-value tags (e.g., app=nginx).
- **Selectors**: Filter objects by labels for routing or management.

### What is a multi-container Pod, and when would you use one?
Multiple containers in one Pod—used for sidecars (e.g., logging) or tightly coupled apps.

### How do you restart a Pod without deleting it?
- For Deployment: `kubectl rollout restart deployment <name>`
- Direct: Edit spec (e.g., add label) or let probes fail.

### What is a StatefulSet, and how does it differ from a Deployment?
Manages stateful apps with stable names and storage. Unlike Deployment, it’s ordered and persistent.

### What is a DaemonSet, and in what scenarios is it useful?
Runs one Pod per node—great for monitoring, logging, or network agents.

### What is a Job and a CronJob in Kubernetes?
- **Job**: One-time task to completion.
- **CronJob**: Scheduled Jobs (e.g., backups).

## Networking

### How does networking work in Kubernetes?
Pods get unique IPs, communicate via flat network (CNI), and use Services for stable access.

### What is a ClusterIP service, and how does it work?
Default Service—virtual IP for internal Pod access, load-balanced by kube-proxy.

### Explain the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services.
- **ClusterIP**: Internal only.
- **NodePort**: Exposes on node ports (30000-32767).
- **LoadBalancer**: Cloud external IP.

### What is an Ingress controller, and why is it used?
Manages HTTP traffic—routes by host/path, handles TLS, and cuts LoadBalancer costs.

### How does Kubernetes handle DNS resolution within a cluster?
CoreDNS assigns names like `<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` for Pod/Service discovery.

### What is a CNI (Container Network Interface), and why is it important?
Standard for Pod networking—assigns IPs and routes traffic (e.g., Flannel, Calico).

### How do Pods communicate with each other in Kubernetes?
Direct IP or via Service ClusterIP—enabled by CNI and DNS.

### What is Network Policy, and how can you enforce it?
Rules to control Pod traffic—enforced with CNI plugins like Calico.

### How does Kubernetes handle external traffic to services?
Via NodePort (node IP:port), LoadBalancer (cloud IP), or Ingress (HTTP routing).

### What is the purpose of kube-proxy in networking?
Sets up Service IPs and load balances traffic to Pods using iptables or IPVS.

## Storage

### What is a Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes?
Cluster storage resource—abstracts disks (e.g., NFS, cloud) for Pods.

### What is a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and how does it relate to a PV?
User request for storage—binds to a matching PV for Pod use.

### Explain the difference between static and dynamic provisioning of storage.
- **Static**: Admin pre-creates PVs.
- **Dynamic**: Auto-creates PVs via StorageClass on demand.

### What is a StorageClass, and how does it work?
Defines storage types (e.g., SSD) for dynamic PV provisioning.

### How do you attach storage to a Pod?
```yaml
volumes:
- name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```
Mount via PVC in Pod spec.

### What are the access modes for Persistent Volumes (e.g., RWO, RWX)?
- **RWO**: Read-write, one node.
- **ROX**: Read-only, many nodes.
- **RWX**: Read-write, many nodes.

### How does Kubernetes handle storage in a multi-node cluster?
Uses PV/PVC with node affinity (RWO) or shared systems (RWX) via CSI.

### What is the role of the CSI (Container Storage Interface) in Kubernetes?
Standardizes storage drivers—enables dynamic provisioning and advanced features.

### How do you troubleshoot storage issues in Kubernetes?
Check Pod events (`kubectl describe`), PVC/PV binding, and StorageClass config.

### What happens to a PV when a PVC is deleted?
Depends on reclaim policy: Retain (keeps PV), Delete (removes PV), or Recycle (wipes data).

## Configuration and Secrets

### What is a ConfigMap, and how is it used?
Stores non-sensitive config data—used as env vars or files in Pods.

### How do you inject environment variables into a Pod?
```yaml
env:
- name: ENV_VAR
    value: "value"
```

### What is a Secret in Kubernetes, and how does it differ from a ConfigMap?
Stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords)—base64-encoded, unlike plain-text ConfigMap.

### How do you create and manage Secrets in Kubernetes?
`kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key=value`

### How can you mount a ConfigMap or Secret as a volume in a Pod?
```yaml
volumes:
- name: config-vol
    configMap:
        name: my-config
```

### What are the security best practices for managing Secrets in Kubernetes?
Encrypt at rest, use RBAC, avoid logging, and rotate regularly.

### How do you update a ConfigMap or Secret without restarting a Pod?
Mount as volume—Pod sees updates automatically (with some delay).

### What is the difference between a base64-encoded Secret and a plain-text ConfigMap?
- **Secret**: Encoded for obscurity.
- **ConfigMap**: Raw text for configs.

### How do you pass sensitive data to an application in Kubernetes?
Use Secrets as env vars or mounted files.

### What is the role of RBAC in securing ConfigMaps and Secrets?
Restricts who can read/write them via Roles and Bindings.

## Scheduling and Resource Management

### How does the Kubernetes scheduler decide where to place a Pod?
Filters nodes (resources, taints), then scores based on policies (e.g., least usage).

### What are resource requests and limits in Kubernetes?
- **Requests**: Minimum needed.
- **Limits**: Max allowed (CPU/memory).

### What happens when a Pod exceeds its resource limits?
CPU throttled, memory OOM-killed.

### What is a taint and toleration, and how are they used?
- **Taint**: Repels Pods from nodes.
- **Toleration**: Allows Pods to ignore taints.

### What is a node selector, and how does it work?
Matches Pods to nodes by labels (e.g., `nodeSelector: disk=ssd`).

### How do you prioritize Pods in Kubernetes?
Use PriorityClass—higher priority Pods get scheduled first.

### What is a PriorityClass, and how do you configure it?
```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
    name: high-priority
value: 1000
```

### How does Kubernetes handle Pod eviction?
Evicts low-priority or over-limit Pods when resources are tight.

### What is a Quality of Service (QoS) class, and how is it assigned to Pods?
- **Guaranteed**: limits=requests.
- **Burstable**: requests<limits.
- **BestEffort**: none—auto-assigned.

### How do you troubleshoot a Pod that is stuck in a Pending state?
Check events (`kubectl describe`), resources, taints, and PVCs.

## Scaling and High Availability

### What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), and how does it work?
Scales Pod replicas based on CPU/memory—needs metrics server.

### How do you configure HPA based on custom metrics?
Use Prometheus Adapter—set custom metric target in HPA spec.

### What is Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA), and when is it useful?
Adjusts Pod resource limits—useful for optimizing fixed workloads.

### How does Kubernetes ensure high availability of applications?
Replicas, multi-node scheduling, and self-healing via controllers.

### What is a rolling update, and how do you perform one in Kubernetes?
Gradual Pod replacement: `kubectl set image deployment/<name> container=new-image`.

### What is the difference between a rolling update and a recreate strategy?
- **Rolling**: Zero downtime, gradual.
- **Recreate**: Kills all, then restarts.

### How does Kubernetes handle failover for Pods?
Controllers (e.g., Deployment) reschedule failed Pods to healthy nodes.

### What is the role of liveness and readiness probes?
- **Liveness**: Restarts unhealthy Pods.
- **Readiness**: Controls traffic readiness.

### How do you configure liveness and readiness probes for a Pod?
```yaml
livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 80
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 80
```

### What happens if a readiness probe fails?
Pod marked NotReady—traffic stops until it passes.

## Security

### What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes?
Controls permissions—links Roles/ClusterRoles to users via Bindings.
```
