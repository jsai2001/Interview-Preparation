  ```python
  import freemarker
  import snowflake.connector
  parameters = {'start_date': '2025-01-01', 'end_date': '2025-03-31', 'region': 'APAC', 'product_category': 'Electronics'}
  fm_config = freemarker.Configuration()
  fm_config.set_directory_for_template_loading('templates/')
  template = fm_config.get_template('sales_report.ftl')
  rendered_sql = template.process(parameters)
  conn = snowflake.connector.connect(user='username', password='password', account='account', warehouse='warehouse', database='database', schema='schema')
  cursor = conn.cursor()
  try:
      cursor.execute(rendered_sql)
      results = cursor.fetchall()
  finally:
      cursor.close()
      conn.close()
  ```
  ```sql
  WITH base_sales AS (
      SELECT product_id, region_id, order_date, sales_amount
      FROM sales_data
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN '${start_date}' AND '${end_date}'
      <#if region??>AND region_id = '${region}'</#if>
      <#if product_category??>AND product_category = '${product_category}'</#if>
  ),
  final_summary AS (
      SELECT COALESCE(SUM(s.sales_amount), 0) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
  )
  SELECT * FROM final_summary;
  ```
