Research suggests Amazon expects negotiation, with successful candidates increasing offers by 10–20%. Propose a counteroffer within the ₹30–50 LPA range, emphasizing total compensation (TC) over base salary alone, as Amazon’s RSUs ramp up in years 3–4. Be prepared to justify with your achievements and market data, and show openness to creative solutions (e.g., higher RSUs or bonuses).[](https://medium.com/%40rogernem/overview-of-the-amazon-interview-process-in-2024-be472e30a045)[](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/amazon-salary-negotiation/)

#### **6. Can you share details about your current compensation package at NielsenIQ?**
- **Intent**: This tests *Earn Trust* and *Are Right, A Lot*. Amazon wants transparency about your current 11.5 LPA salary to gauge negotiation leverage and ensure your expectations are realistic. They also assess if you’re aware of market standards.
- **Guidance**: Be honest about your 11.5 LPA salary but frame it to show you’re underpaid relative to your impact and market rates. Emphasize your achievements and certifications to justify seeking a higher package. Avoid revealing competing offers unless they’re strong and verifiable, as Amazon may request proof.
- **Sample Response**:
  - “My current compensation at NielsenIQ is 11.5 LPA, which includes my base salary and standard benefits. However, I believe this doesn’t fully reflect the value I’ve delivered, such as automating CI/CD pipelines to reduce deployment time by 25% or optimizing AWS infrastructure to cut costs by 25%. My certifications in DevOps, Jenkins, and Flask APIs, combined with market research indicating ₹30–50 LPA for Application Engineers with my experience in India, suggest I’m underpaid for my skill set. I’m excited about the opportunity at Amazon to contribute at a larger scale and align my compensation with my impact and industry standards.”
- **Key Points**: Disclose 11.5 LPA honestly but pivot to your achievements and market data. Avoid focusing on dissatisfaction; emphasize growth and value. If pressed, reiterate your focus on total compensation fit for Amazon’s role.
