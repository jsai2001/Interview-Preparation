# Bar Raiser Interview Questions

## Behavioral Questions

**1. Describe a time you went above and beyond to meet a customer’s needs. How did you identify their needs, and what was the outcome? (*Customer Obsession*)**
- At NielsenIQ India, I went above and beyond to ensure a retail client’s trust in our real-time data aggregation system by proactively addressing a critical inconsistency in our predictive models. The client relied on three models—A, B, and C—for buyer behavior analysis, with B and C frequently compared in their dashboards, but all needed to align with the initial requirement for consistent, accurate metrics.

**Identifying the Need**: While enhancing model C, I discovered a discrepancy: models B and C aligned, but their buyer metrics diverged from model A, risking unrealistic expectations for the client. Although the client hadn’t noticed, I recognized this as a violation of their core requirement for reliable data, identified through proactive analysis of query performance and data outputs.

**Actions Taken**: I conducted a thorough investigation to pinpoint the root cause in model A’s data aggregation logic. I optimized the underlying Snowflake queries, introducing validations and efficient joins to ensure consistency across all models. I also implemented AWS CloudWatch monitoring to track query performance and detect future discrepancies. Collaborating with the data science team, I synchronized models B and C with A, ensuring seamless integration. I proactively informed the client about the issue and our resolution, reinforcing transparency.

**Outcome**: The fix aligned all models, improving data accuracy by 45% and meeting the client’s original requirements. Query performance increased by 20%, enabling faster real-time reporting. The client appreciated our proactive approach, which prevented misleading insights and strengthened their confidence in our analytics, enhancing their marketing decisions. This effort demonstrated my commitment to exceeding client expectations by delivering reliable, high-quality data solutions.

**2. Share an example of a project where you took ownership of a challenging task with minimal guidance. What steps did you take, and what was the result? (*Ownership*)**

**or**

**21. Describe an innovative solution you implemented to solve a problem. What made it innovative? (*Invent and Simplify*, *Think Big*)**

- At NielsenIQ India, I took ownership of optimizing a real-time data aggregation system using Snowflake SQL with minimal guidance. Slow data processing delayed client reports, so I analyzed bottlenecks and applied advanced Snowflake techniques: window functions, clustering keys, dynamic SQL with Freemarker templates, and query profiling. Below, I detail these techniques, including window function examples and an end-to-end example of a Python script passing parameters to a Freemarker template for conditional CTEs.

### Snowflake SQL Techniques Used

#### 1. Window Functions
I used `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `LAG()` for efficient data analytics:
- **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, 
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_sequence 
  FROM sales_data;
  ```
  **Benefit**: Tracked customer order sequences, simplifying purchase pattern analysis without subqueries, reducing query time.
- **`RANK()`**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT product_id, sales_amount, 
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales_amount DESC) AS sales_rank 
  FROM product_sales;
  ```
  **Benefit**: Identified top products per region, streamlining leaderboards and avoiding complex joins.
- **`LAG()`**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT order_id, order_date, sales_amount, 
         LAG(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS previous_sale 
  FROM sales_data;
  ```
  **Benefit**: Enabled sales growth calculations, optimizing time-series analysis.
- **Overall Benefits**: Reduced query execution time by ~15%, enabling faster real-time reporting.

#### 2. Query Optimization with Clustering Keys
- **Process**: Identified slow queries on large tables using Snowflake’s query profiling. Applied clustering keys on `order_date` and `region_id`:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE sales_data CLUSTER BY (order_date, region_id);
  ```
- **Execution**: Snowflake reorganized data to minimize scans, speeding up queries filtering by `order_date`. Monitored performance via query history, adjusting keys as needed.
- **Example**: For a dashboard showing daily sales by region, clustering reduced query time from 10 to 3 seconds.
- **Outcome**: Improved query performance by ~20%, enabling real-time data access.

#### 3. Dynamic SQL with Freemarker Templates
- **Process**: Developed a Python script to pass parameters (`start_date`, `end_date`, `region`, `product_category`) to a Freemarker template, generating conditional CTEs for flexible reports.
- **Python Script**:
  ```python
  import freemarker
  import snowflake.connector

  parameters = {
      'start_date': '2025-01-01',
      'end_date': '2025-03-31',
      'region': 'APAC',
      'product_category': 'Electronics'
  }

  fm_config = freemarker.Configuration()
  fm_config.set_directory_for_template_loading('templates/')
  template = fm_config.get_template('sales_report.ftl')
  rendered_sql = template.process(parameters)

  conn = snowflake.connector.connect(user='username', password='password', account='account', 
                                    warehouse='warehouse', database='database', schema='schema')
  cursor = conn.cursor()
  try:
      cursor.execute(rendered_sql)
      results = cursor.fetchall()
      print(results)
  finally:
      cursor.close()
      conn.close()
  ```
- **Freemarker Template (sales_report.ftl)**:
  ```sql
  WITH base_sales AS (
      SELECT product_id, region_id, order_date, sales_amount
      FROM sales_data
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN '${start_date}' AND '${end_date}'
      <#if region??>AND region_id = '${region}'</#if>
      <#if product_category??>AND product_category = '${product_category}'</#if>
  ),
  <#if region??>
  region_summary AS (
      SELECT r.region_name, SUM(s.sales_amount) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      JOIN regions r ON s.region_id = r.region_id
      GROUP BY r.region_name
  ),
  </#if>
  <#if product_category??>
  category_summary AS (
      SELECT p.product_category, SUM(s.sales_amount) AS category_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
      GROUP BY p.product_category
  ),
  </#if>
  final_summary AS (
      SELECT 
          <#if region??>r.region_name,</#if>
          <#if product_category??>c.product_category,</#if>
          COALESCE(SUM(s.sales_amount), 0) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      <#if region??>JOIN region_summary r ON s.region_id = r.region_id</#if>
      <#if product_category??>JOIN category_summary c ON s.product_id = c.product_id</#if>
      GROUP BY 
          <#if region??>r.region_name,</#if>
          <#if product_category??>c.product_category</#if>
  )
  SELECT * FROM final_summary;
  ```
- **Example Output (With Parameters)**:
  ```sql
  WITH base_sales AS (
      SELECT product_id, region_id, order_date, sales_amount
      FROM sales_data
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-03-31'
          AND region_id = 'APAC'
          AND product_category = 'Electronics'
  ),
  region_summary AS (
      SELECT r.region_name, SUM(s.sales_amount) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      JOIN regions r ON s.region_id = r.region_id
      GROUP BY r.region_name
  ),
  category_summary AS (
      SELECT p.product_category, SUM(s.sales_amount) AS category_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
      GROUP BY p.product_category
  ),
  final_summary AS (
      SELECT r.region_name, c.product_category, COALESCE(SUM(s.sales_amount), 0) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
      JOIN region_summary r ON s.region_id = r.region_id
      JOIN category_summary c ON s.product_id = c.product_id
      GROUP BY r.region_name, c.product_category
  )
  SELECT * FROM final_summary;
  ```
- **Example Output (No Optional Parameters)**:
  ```sql
  WITH base_sales AS (
      SELECT product_id, region_id, order_date, sales_amount
      FROM sales_data
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-03-31'
  ),
  final_summary AS (
      SELECT COALESCE(SUM(s.sales_amount), 0) AS total_sales
      FROM base_sales s
  )
  SELECT * FROM final_summary;
  ```
- **Outcome**: Eliminated manual query updates, reducing report generation time from hours to minutes, with 45% improved reporting accuracy.

#### 4. Performance Tuning with Query Profiling
- **Process**: Used Snowflake’s Query Profile to identify bottlenecks (e.g., excessive scans) in a sales aggregation query:
  ```sql
  SELECT p.product_id, r.region_name, SUM(s.sales_amount)
  FROM sales_data s
  JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
  JOIN regions r ON s.region_id = r.region_id
  GROUP BY p.product_id, r.region_name;
  ```
- **Optimization**: Added clustering key on `region_id`, used result caching, and rewrote with a CTE:
  ```sql
  WITH pre_agg AS (
      SELECT region_id, product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
      FROM sales_data
      GROUP BY region_id, product_id
  )
  SELECT p.product_id, r.region_name, a.total_sales
  FROM pre_agg a
  JOIN products p ON a.product_id = p.product_id
  JOIN regions r ON a.region_id = r.region_id;
  ```
- **Example**: For a product performance dashboard, query time dropped from 12 to 4 seconds.
- **Outcome**: Improved query performance by ~25%, ensuring fast data delivery.

### Real-Time Example
For a client’s Q1 2025 sales dashboard:
- **Problem**: Slow queries (~10 seconds) due to unoptimized data access.
- **Steps**: Applied `RANK()` and `LAG()` for analytics, clustered on `order_date` and `region_id`, used Freemarker for dynamic CTEs, and optimized queries via profiling.
- **Outcome**: Dashboard load time reduced to ~3 seconds, with 20% faster data processing and 45% improved reporting accuracy, enhancing client satisfaction.

### Final Result
These techniques improved data processing efficiency by 20% and reporting accuracy by 45%, delivering fast, reliable insights and boosting client satisfaction.

**3. Tell me about a time you simplified a complex process or system. How did you approach it, and what was the impact? (*Invent and Simplify*)**
- At NielsenIQ India, I simplified a complex cloud infrastructure provisioning process for a real-time data aggregation system, previously slowed by manual, error-prone configurations across AWS services and inefficient Snowflake query performance. My goal was to streamline provisioning, deployment, and monitoring to enhance efficiency and reliability for client reporting. I leveraged Terraform, GitHub Actions, AWS CloudWatch, and Snowflake SQL optimizations, interlinking these tools to create a cohesive, automated workflow. Below, I detail the approach with a focus on elaborating AWS CloudWatch, including code examples, steps for accessing logs via UI and CLI, linking to AWS resources, and pre- and post-creation steps, all interlinked with other components.

**Approach**:

1. **Assessment**:
   - **Problem**: Manual AWS resource setups (EC2, S3, RDS, EKS) and unoptimized Snowflake queries caused delays and errors in the data aggregation pipeline, impacting client report delivery.
   - **Action**: I identified bottlenecks in AWS configurations and Snowflake query performance, such as repetitive EC2 setups and full table scans in Snowflake.

2. **Automation with Terraform**:
   - **Solution**: I used Terraform to automate provisioning of AWS resources (EC2, S3, EKS), ensuring consistency.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```hcl
     # main.tf
     module "ec2_instance" {
       source        = "./modules/ec2"
       ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
       instance_type = "t3.medium"
       subnet_id     = aws_subnet.main.id
       tags          = { Name = "DataAggregationServer" }
     }

     resource "aws_eks_cluster" "data_cluster" {
       name     = "nielseniq-eks"
       role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks_role.arn
       vpc_config {
         subnet_ids = [aws_subnet.main.id]
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Interlink**: Terraform provisioned EC2 instances and EKS clusters, which were monitored by CloudWatch for health and performance, ensuring the data aggregation application ran reliably.

3. **CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions**:
   - **Solution**: I integrated Terraform with GitHub Actions to automate infrastructure updates and application deployments.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```yaml
     # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     name: Deploy Infrastructure
     on:
       push:
         branches: [ main ]
     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - name: Setup Terraform
             uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
             with:
               terraform_version: 1.5.0
           - name: Terraform Init
             run: terraform init
           - name: Terraform Apply
             run: terraform apply -auto-approve
             env:
               AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
               AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
           - name: Deploy to EKS
             run: |
               aws eks update-kubeconfig --name nielseniq-eks
               kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
     ```
   - **Interlink**: GitHub Actions deployed the application to EKS, with CloudWatch monitoring deployment health and triggering alerts if issues arose.

4. **AWS CloudWatch Monitoring**:
   - **Solution**: I configured CloudWatch to monitor AWS resources (EC2, EKS) and application performance, setting up custom metrics, alarms, and log groups for proactive issue detection and troubleshooting.
   - **Pre-Creation Steps**:
     1. **IAM Role Setup**: Created an IAM role with permissions for CloudWatch (`CloudWatchFullAccess`) and attached it to EC2 and EKS resources.
        ```hcl
        # iam.tf
        resource "aws_iam_role" "cloudwatch_role" {
          name = "CloudWatchRole"
          assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
            Version = "2012-10-17"
            Statement = [{
              Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
              Effect = "Allow"
              Principal = { Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com" }
            }]
          })
        }

        resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "cloudwatch_policy" {
          role       = aws_iam_role.cloudwatch_role.name
          policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchFullAccess"
        }
        ```
     2. **Log Group Creation**: Defined a CloudWatch Log Group to store application and resource logs.
        ```hcl
        # cloudwatch.tf
        resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "app_logs" {
          name              = "/nielseniq/data-aggregation"
          retention_in_days = 7
        }
        ```
     3. **CloudWatch Agent Installation**: Configured the CloudWatch Agent on EC2 instances to collect system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory) and application logs.
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_ssm_document" "install_cloudwatch_agent" {
          name          = "InstallCloudWatchAgent"
          document_type = "Command"
          content = jsonencode({
            schemaVersion = "2.2"
            description   = "Install and configure CloudWatch Agent"
            mainSteps = [{
              action = "aws:runShellScript"
              name   = "installAgent"
              inputs = {
                runCommand = [
                  "sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent",
                  "sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard"
                ]
              }
            }]
          })
        }
        ```
   - **Creation of CloudWatch Alarms and Metrics**:
     - **Metric Alarm**: Set up an alarm for high CPU usage on EC2 instances.
       ```hcl
       # cloudwatch.tf
       resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu" {
         alarm_name          = "HighCPUUtilization"
         comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
         evaluation_periods  = 2
         metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
         namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
         period              = 300
         statistic           = "Average"
         threshold           = 80
         alarm_description   = "Triggers when EC2 CPU exceeds 80% for 10 minutes"
         dimensions = {
           InstanceId = module.ec2_instance.instance_id
         }
         alarm_actions = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
       }
       ```
     - **Custom Metric**: Pushed custom application metrics (e.g., query latency) to CloudWatch.
       ```hcl
       resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter" "query_latency" {
         name           = "QueryLatency"
         pattern        = "query_duration_ms"
         log_group_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.app_logs.name
         metric_transformation {
           name      = "QueryLatency"
           namespace = "NielsenIQ/App"
           value     = "1"
         }
       }
       ```
   - **Post-Creation Steps**:
     1. **Link to AWS Resources**: Attached the IAM role to EC2 instances and EKS nodes via Terraform, ensuring CloudWatch could collect metrics and logs.
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ec2_profile" {
          name = "EC2CloudWatchProfile"
          role = aws_iam_role.cloudwatch_role.name
        }

        module "ec2_instance" {
          source             = "./modules/ec2"
          ami                = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
          instance_type      = "t3.medium"
          subnet_id          = aws_subnet.main.id
          iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.ec2_profile.name
        }
        ```
     2. **Log Configuration**: Configured the CloudWatch Agent to stream application logs to the `/nielseniq/data-aggregation` log group using a configuration file:
        ```json
        {
          "logs": {
            "logs_collected": {
              "files": {
                "collect_list": [
                  {
                    "file_path": "/var/log/data-aggregation/app.log",
                    "log_group_name": "/nielseniq/data-aggregation",
                    "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
     3. **Alert Setup**: Linked alarms to an SNS topic for notifications to the team.
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_sns_topic" "alerts" {
          name = "nielseniq-alerts"

**4. Share an example of a decision you made with incomplete information. How did you ensure it was the right call? (*Are Right, A Lot*)**

**or**

**7. Share an example of a time you refused to compromise on quality, even under pressure. What was the situation, and how did you handle it? (*Insist on the Highest Standards*)****

At NielsenIQ India, I faced a situation where I had to make a critical decision with incomplete information to ensure our real-time data aggregation system delivered reliable buyer behavior analytics for a retail client. The client used three predictive models—A, B, and C—with B and C frequently compared in their dashboards, requiring consistent and accurate metrics as per the initial project requirements. The data science team provided a specification stating that model C’s aggregated values should align with and enhance model B’s outputs, similar to how an iPhone Pro should outperform an iPhone Basic. However, no consistency checks were defined to validate this relationship.

**Decision Context and Incomplete Information**: While working on model C enhancements, I noticed that its buyer metrics didn’t consistently align with model B, potentially leading to misleading insights. The data science specification lacked details on how to validate this alignment, and there was no clear guidance on cross-model dependencies or consistency checks. Without complete information on the expected behavior or validation methods, I decided to proactively address this discrepancy to meet the client’s need for reliable data.

**Actions Taken to Ensure the Right Call**:
1. **Proactive Analysis**: I analyzed query outputs and performance logs in Snowflake and AWS CloudWatch, identifying that model C’s aggregations diverged from model B due to inconsistent data logic in model C. This confirmed the need for alignment to meet the client’s expectations.
2. **Initiative with POC**: Lacking specific guidance, I took the initiative to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) script to compare model B and C outputs. I extracted model B’s query logic and created a validation script to ensure model C’s metrics enhanced B’s, as required. For example, I compared key metrics like total buyer counts across user combinations to confirm model C provided superior insights, akin to an iPhone Pro offering enhanced features over a Basic model.
3. **Collaboration and Validation**: I presented the POC findings to the data science team and project leads, explaining the inconsistency and its potential impact on client trust. Through discussions, we agreed on a standardized approach to align model C with B, incorporating additional validation checks to ensure model C consistently outperformed B in relevant metrics.
4. **Query Optimization**: I optimized Snowflake queries for model C, introducing efficient joins and validations to align with model B’s logic while enhancing performance. I also set up AWS CloudWatch monitoring to track query consistency and performance, ensuring ongoing reliability.
5. **Client Transparency**: I proactively informed the client about the potential issue and our resolution plan, reinforcing trust by demonstrating our commitment to their requirements.

**Outcome**: The decision to address the inconsistency aligned model C with model B, improving data accuracy by 45% and ensuring model C delivered enhanced metrics, meeting the client’s expectations for reliable buyer insights. Query performance improved by 20%, enabling faster real-time reporting. The client appreciated our proactive approach, which prevented misleading analytics and strengthened their confidence in our platform, enhancing their marketing decisions. By taking initiative with incomplete information, collaborating with stakeholders, and leveraging technical tools, I ensured the right call was made, delivering a high-quality solution that exceeded client needs.

**5. Describe a time you learned a new technology or tool to solve a problem. How did you approach learning it, and what was the outcome? (*Learn and Be Curious*)**

At NielsenIQ India, I faced a challenge in our real-time data aggregation system where the client required flexible, dynamic sales reports with varying filters (e.g., date ranges, regions, product categories), but static Snowflake SQL queries required frequent manual updates, delaying delivery. To address this, I decided to learn and implement Freemarker Templates, a new tool for me, to generate dynamic SQL queries, streamlining the reporting process.

**Approach to Learning Freemarker Templates**:
1. **Self-Study**: I explored the Freemarker documentation and online tutorials, focusing on its templating syntax and integration with SQL for dynamic query generation.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: I created a local test environment, writing sample Freemarker templates to generate simple SQL queries, experimenting with conditional logic to handle dynamic filters.
3. **Team Collaboration**: I consulted with data engineers to understand how Freemarker could integrate with our Snowflake-based system and Python scripts, ensuring compatibility with existing workflows.
4. **Iterative Implementation**: I started with a basic template for date-based filters, progressively adding complex logic for optional parameters like regions and product categories, testing each iteration for accuracy.

**Actions Taken**:
I developed a Freemarker template to generate dynamic Snowflake SQL queries based on client inputs, such as:
- A base query filtering by mandatory date ranges.
- Conditional clauses for optional filters (e.g., region, product category) using Freemarker’s `<#if>` directives.
I integrated this with a Python script to pass parameters from client inputs, ensuring seamless query execution in Snowflake. To support reliability, I set up AWS CloudWatch monitoring to track query performance and detect errors. I also collaborated with the data science team to validate the generated queries against client requirements, ensuring accuracy.

**Outcome**:
The Freemarker-based solution reduced report generation time from hours to minutes, improving efficiency by 20%. It enhanced reporting accuracy by 45%, as dynamic queries eliminated manual errors, meeting the client’s need for flexible, reliable insights. The client praised the faster, tailored reports, which improved their marketing decisions. I documented the process and trained the team on Freemarker, enhancing our capability to handle dynamic reporting needs. This experience deepened my expertise in adaptive data solutions, reinforcing my commitment to learning new tools to solve complex problems effectively.

**6. Tell me about a time you mentored or coached a colleague. How did you help them grow, and what was the result? (*Hire and Develop the Best*)**

At NielsenIQ India, I mentored junior DevOps engineers to help them grow in handling complex tasks related to our real-time data aggregation system, aligning with our goal to deliver reliable client analytics. My approach focused on gradually building their skills while ensuring project quality.

**How I Helped Them Grow**:
When working on high-priority tickets or new predictive models, I assigned junior engineers testing and validation tasks to familiarize them with the system. For example, I’d provide tasks to validate Snowflake SQL query outputs or test AWS resource configurations, ensuring they understood the basics. As they gained confidence, I incrementally increased task complexity, guiding them toward developing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or optimizing Snowflake queries for model updates. 

For instance, when a junior engineer struggled with a model deployment ticket, I gave them end-to-end freedom for 2-3 days within a sprint to explore solutions independently, fostering problem-solving skills. I’d then review their progress, offering hints—like suggesting specific query optimizations or CloudWatch log checks—if they were stuck. If they still couldn’t progress and I was handling a critical task, I’d either complete the task myself once or twice to demonstrate the process or reassign it to a more experienced colleague, ensuring project timelines were met. In such cases, I reassigned the junior engineer simpler tasks, like creating test cases or validating outputs, to build their confidence.

**Result**:
Most engineers I mentored successfully progressed to independently handling complex model deployments within a few sprints, significantly improving their technical proficiency. For example, one mentee mastered deploying models on AWS EKS and optimizing Snowflake queries, contributing to a 15% boost in team productivity, as noted in my resume. This not only enhanced their skills but also ensured consistent, high-quality deliverables for clients, strengthening our analytics platform’s reliability. My mentorship approach—balancing guidance, autonomy, and support—helped develop capable engineers who could handle critical tasks, aligning with NielsenIQ’s commitment to fostering talent.

**8. Tell me about a time you proposed or implemented a solution with significant, long-term impact. What was the outcome? (*Think Big*)**

At NielsenIQ India, I proposed and implemented a solution to strengthen our automated deployment pipeline for a real-time data aggregation system after a production issue revealed gaps in validation, affecting client analytics reliability. The system, powered by AWS (EKS, ALB, S3) and Snowflake, required robust checks to ensure seamless deployments. My solution enhanced the pipeline with AWS CloudWatch for comprehensive runtime monitoring and GitHub Actions for automated validation, delivering significant, long-term improvements.

**Solution and Implementation**:
A production issue occurred where an undetected Application Load Balancer (ALB) misconfiguration caused intermittent client access failures, undermining trust in our analytics platform. To address this, I proposed enhancing our existing automated pipeline with real-time validation and monitoring:

1. **Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow**: I updated the GitHub Actions pipeline to include post-deployment validation steps, such as testing ALB links for accessibility and verifying Snowflake query outputs for accuracy.
2. **AWS CloudWatch Runtime Monitoring**: I configured CloudWatch to monitor deployment health and system performance in real time, ensuring immediate detection of issues. This involved:
   - **Custom Metrics**: Created metrics for EKS pod health (e.g., pod crash counts) and Snowflake query performance (e.g., query latency), enabling granular tracking of system behavior.
   - **Log Groups**: Set up log groups to capture application and deployment logs, facilitating troubleshooting.
   - **Alarms**: Established alarms for anomalies like high ALB request latency or Snowflake query failures, with notifications sent via SNS to the team.
   - **Dashboards**: Built a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize metrics, providing a unified view of system health for quick diagnostics.
3. **Output Validation in CI/CD**: I added validation steps in GitHub Actions to check ALB links using HTTP requests and validate Snowflake query results against expected metrics during deployment, ensuring errors were caught early.

**Execution**:
- **Terraform for Resource Provisioning**: Used Terraform to provision AWS resources consistently, including ALB and EKS, ensuring a stable foundation for monitoring.

**9. Share an example of a quick decision you made to keep a project moving forward. What risks did you consider, and what was the result? (*Bias for Action*)**

**or**

**10. Describe a time you achieved a goal with limited resources. How did you maximize efficiency? (*Frugality*)**

**or**

**13. Describe a time you disagreed with a team decision but committed to it. How did you handle the situation, and what was the outcome? (*Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit*)**

**or**

**19. Tell me about a suggestion you made that helped a project move out of a critical state. How did you convince your team? (*Are Right, A Lot*, *Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit*)**

At NielsenIQ India, I made a quick decision to keep a critical release of our real-time data aggregation system on track for a retail client. The system relied on three predictive models—A, B, and C—where A was the base model, B was an intermediate model, and C was an enhanced version of B. The client frequently compared B and C in their dashboards, but all models needed to align on common conditions to meet the requirement for consistent buyer metrics. With a release deadline approaching, I identified that B and C were aligned, but model A’s metrics diverged, risking unreliable client insights.

**Quick Decision**: As the release was imminent and model C’s UI development required two additional sprints, I decided to prioritize aligning models B and C immediately while planning a subsequent upgrade to synchronize all three models (A, B, and C) in the next release. This allowed us to meet the deadline without delaying critical client deliverables.

**Risks Considered**:
1. **Client Perception**: Delivering B and C without full alignment with A could lead to temporary inconsistencies if the client noticed discrepancies in base metrics, potentially affecting trust.
2. **Technical Debt**: Deferring model A’s alignment might increase complexity in the next sprint, requiring additional effort to refactor and validate.
3. **Resource Constraints**: Diverting focus to align B and C could strain team resources, as I was also handling high-priority deployment tasks.
To mitigate these, I validated that B and C’s alignment covered the client’s primary use cases and communicated transparently with the client about the phased approach, ensuring their expectations were managed.

**Actions Taken**:
1. I optimized Snowflake queries for models B and C to ensure their metrics matched for common conditions, using efficient joins and validations.
2. I set up AWS CloudWatch monitoring to track query performance and detect discrepancies in real time, ensuring reliability for the release.
3. I collaborated with the data science team to confirm B and C’s alignment and planned a sprint to upgrade model A, ensuring all models would align post-release.
4. I informed the client about the interim solution and the upcoming upgrade, maintaining transparency.

### **11. Tell me about a time you built trust with a skeptical stakeholder or team member. How did you do it? (*Earn Trust*)**

At NielsenIQ India, I built trust with my skeptical manager while optimizing a predictive model for our real-time data aggregation system, critical for delivering accurate client analytics. The manager was concerned that completing the development and testing within a single sprint was unrealistic, given the model’s complexity and the tight timeline.

**How I Built Trust**:
1. **Transparent Communication**: I engaged with the project lead (PL) early to secure approval, presenting a detailed plan outlining how I’d optimize the model using Snowflake SQL and validate it efficiently.

- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch tracked system health (EKS pod status, ALB latency) and query performance, with custom metrics and alarms for proactive issue detection.
- **API Integration**: A Python-based backend used Flask to provide RESTful APIs, enabling seamless client interactions with filtered data.
- **Workflow**: Client inputs triggered dynamic Snowflake queries, processed data was stored in S3, and results were served via the EKS-hosted application, with CloudWatch ensuring reliability.

**Specific Contribution**:
As a DevOps Engineer, I took ownership of optimizing the system’s deployment and data processing efficiency, addressing performance bottlenecks and ensuring reliability. My contributions included:

1. **Infrastructure Automation**: I implemented Terraform to automate provisioning of AWS resources (EKS, ALB, S3), creating reusable modules for consistency. For example, I standardized EKS cluster setups, reducing manual errors.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**: I designed a GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployments and validate ALB links and Snowflake query outputs post-deployment, ensuring immediate issue detection.
3. **Snowflake Query Optimization**: I optimized Snowflake queries using clustering keys (e.g., on `order_date`, `region_id`) and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to reduce data scan times. I also integrated Freemarker Templates with Python to generate dynamic queries for client-specific filters, eliminating manual query updates.
4. **Monitoring Setup**: I configured AWS CloudWatch with custom metrics for EKS pod health and Snowflake query latency, setting up alarms and a dashboard for real-time visibility. Logs were streamed to `/nielseniq/data-aggregation` for troubleshooting.
5. **Model Consistency**: I identified and resolved inconsistencies between models A, B, and C, ensuring B and C aligned for client comparisons and planning a phased fix for model A, maintaining release timelines.
6. **Team Enablement**: I documented processes and mentored junior engineers on Terraform, Snowflake, and CloudWatch, boosting team productivity.

**Impact**:
My contributions reduced infrastructure provisioning time by 20% and deployment errors by 30% through automation and validation, as noted in my resume. Snowflake optimizations improved query performance by 20% and data accuracy by 45%, ensuring reliable analytics.

**18. Describe a critical issue you fixed in a production environment. How did you identify and resolve it? (*Dive Deep*, *Bias for Action*)**
At NielsenIQ India, I resolved a critical production issue in our real-time data aggregation system where the Application Load Balancer (ALB) was intermittently failing to route traffic to our EKS-hosted application, causing client access disruptions. This jeopard of issue risked undermining client trust in our analytics platform, which relied on consistent access to predictive models (A, B, and C) for buyer behavior insights.

**Identifying the Issue**:
I noticed the issue through AWS CloudWatch alerts, which I had previously configured to monitor ALB health. An alarm triggered for high request latency (>1 second), and logs in `/nielseniq/deployment-logs` showed intermittent HTTP 503 errors. Diving deeper, I analyzed CloudWatch metrics and found that the ALB’s target group was intermittently marking EKS pods as unhealthy due to misconfigured health checks. I cross-referenced EKS pod logs via the AWS Console and CLI (`aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /nielseniq/deployment-logs --filter-pattern "health-check-failed"`) to confirm the issue stemmed from a recent deployment update that altered the application’s health check endpoint.

**Resolving the Issue**:
1. **Immediate Action**: To restore service, I rolled back the deployment to the last stable version using GitHub Actions, which I had set up for automated rollbacks, minimizing downtime within 10 minutes.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: I reproduced the issue in a staging environment, identifying that the health check path was incorrectly set to `/health` instead of `/api/health` in the ALB target group configuration.
3. **Fix Implementation**: I updated the Terraform configuration to correct the health check path:
   - **Original (Incorrect)**: Health check path set to `/health`.
   - **Fixed**:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_lb_target_group" "app_tg" {
       name     = "nielseniq-app-tg"
       port     = 80
       protocol = "HTTP"
       vpc_id   = aws_vpc.main.id
       health_check {
         path     = "/api/health"
         matcher  = "200"
         interval = 30
       }
     }
     ```
4. **Validation**: I added a validation step in the GitHub Actions pipeline to test the ALB link post-deployment (`curl -f $ALB_URL/api/health`), ensuring future deployments wouldn’t fail.
5. **Monitoring Enhancement**: I strengthened CloudWatch monitoring by adding a custom metric for health check failures and an alarm to alert on 503 errors, ensuring faster detection.
6. **Client Communication**: I informed the client about the issue and resolution transparently, reinforcing trust.

**Outcome**:
The fix restored full access within 30 minutes, achieving 99.9% system reliability. The updated pipeline and CloudWatch enhancements reduced future deployment errors by 30%, as noted in my resume. Snowflake query performance, critical for the models, remained unaffected, maintaining 45% improved data accuracy for client analytics. The client appreciated the swift resolution and transparency, strengthening their confidence in our platform. This rapid, detailed response mitigated a critical issue and improved long-term system stability.
