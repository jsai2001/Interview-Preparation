from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask import XRay

# Initialize X-Ray for a Flask app (example)
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
XRay(app)

@xray_recorder.capture('my_lambda_function')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Example: Simulate a traced operation
    subsegment = xray_recorder.begin_subsegment('api_call')
    try:
        # Simulate an API call or processing
        result = perform_operation(event)
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': result
        }
    except Exception as e:
        xray_recorder.record_exception(e)
        raise
    finally:
        xray_recorder.end_subsegment()

def perform_operation(event):
    # Simulated operation
    return {"message": "Operation completed"}
```

# Setting Up AWS X-Ray Application Notes

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Set up an AWS X-Ray instrumented application to demonstrate its tracing capabilities.
- **Tool**: AWS CloudFormation to deploy a sample application for X-Ray monitoring.

## Steps to Set Up X-Ray Demo Application
1. **Navigate to X-Ray Console**:
   - In the **CloudWatch Console**, go to **X-Ray Traces** > **Service Map**.
   - Note: No applications are initially set up, and manual setup is time-consuming.
2. **Create Sample Application**:
   - Click **Set Up Demo App** > **Create Sample Application with CloudFormation**.
   - **Stack Configuration**:
     - Stack Name: `X-Ray-demo-app`.
     - Leave all other settings as default.
     - Acknowledge CloudFormation may create resources.
     - Click **Submit** to initiate stack creation.
   - **Note**: Stack creation takes time; outputs provide the application URL once complete.
3. **Access the Application**:
   - In **CloudFormation**, navigate to the stack’s **Outputs** tab.
   - Copy and open the provided URL to access the **Scorekeep** application.
4. **Use the Scorekeep Application**:
   - A simple application to demonstrate X-Ray tracing across services.
   - Steps:
     - Specify a **username** and create a **session**.
     - Create a new game (e.g., name: `demo`, rules: `tic-tac-toe`).
     - Play the game, generating backend requests for X-Ray to trace.
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates how X-Ray tracks requests across different services.

## Key Observations
- **Sample Application**: AWS-provided **Scorekeep** app simplifies setup and demonstrates X-Ray’s ability to monitor service interactions.
- **CloudFormation**: Automates deployment of the application and required resources.
- **Next Steps**: Analyze the service map in X-Ray to visualize request flows and service interactions.

## Example Code Snippet
Below is an example of a CloudFormation template snippet to enable X-Ray tracing for a Lambda function within the demo application:

```yaml
Resources:
  ScorekeepLambda:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: ScorekeepFunction
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Code:
        S3Bucket: my-bucket

# Tracing Requests and Analyzing Traces in AWS X-Ray Notes

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Use AWS X-Ray to trace requests and analyze performance in the **Scorekeep** demo application, deployed via CloudFormation.
- **Objective**: Visualize service interactions, identify bottlenecks, and analyze request details using X-Ray’s service map and trace views.

## Steps to Trace Requests and Analyze Traces
1. **Generate Requests in Scorekeep App**:
   - Access the Scorekeep application via the URL from CloudFormation outputs.
   - Create a new session (e.g., game name: `demo`, rules: `tic-tac-toe`).
   - Perform actions (e.g., create game, play) to generate backend requests for tracing.
2. **Navigate to X-Ray Service Map**:
   - In **AWS CloudWatch Console**, go to **X-Ray Traces** > **Service Map**.
   - Displays **nodes** (services/resources) and **edges** (interactions between them).
   - Example Services in Scorekeep:
     - **Client**: Initiates requests.
     - **ECS Container**: Processes requests.
     - **SNS Topic**: Handles real-time data updates.
     - **DynamoDB Tables**: Includes `game`, `session`, `state`, and `user` tables.
3. **Analyze Service Map**:
   - Zoom in/out using mouse scroll or buttons to explore interactions.
   - Click a node (e.g., ECS container) to view metrics like **response time**.
   - Visual indicators:
     - **Circle around node**: Indicates request status.
     - **Color coding**: Yellow for slow requests, red for failed requests (e.g., 50% red if half the requests fail).
4. **Trace Requests**:
   - Navigate to **Traces** tab in X-Ray.
   - Filter traces:
     - By **Trace ID** for specific requests.
     - By node (e.g., `service id name: "Scorekeep", type: client`).
     - Alternative: From Service Map, click a node (e.g., Client) > **View Traces**.
   - Adjust time range (e.g., last 15 minutes) to view more requests.
   - Select a trace (e.g., POST request) to view details.
5. **Analyze Trace Details**:
   - **Trace Map**: Shows request flow (e.g., Client → ECS Container → DynamoDB `game` and `session` tables).
   - **Timeline**: Displays duration of each step (e.g., ECS processing, DynamoDB queries).
   - Identifies bottlenecks or failures by showing where requests slow down or fail.

## Key Observations
- **Service Map**: Provides a visual overview of application architecture and dependencies without prior knowledge of services.
- **Metrics**: Highlights response times and request statuses, aiding in performance analysis.
- **Tracing**: Detailed request paths help pinpoint slow or failed operations.
- **Use Case**: Simplifies troubleshooting by showing request flow, durations, and failure points.

## Example Code Snippet
Below is an example of instrumenting a Python Lambda function with AWS X-Ray to capture traces, ensuring visibility in the service map:

```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.boto import patch_all

# Patch boto3 for X-Ray tracing
patch_all()

@xray_recorder.capture('scorekeep_function')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Simulate processing a request
    subsegment = xray_recorder.begin_subsegment('dynamo_operation')
    try:
        # Example: Query DynamoDB table
        import boto3
        dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
        response = dynamodb.get_item(
            TableName='game',
            Key={'game_id': {'S': event.get('game_id', 'demo')}}
        )
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': response.get('Item', {})
        }
    except Exception as e:
        xray_recorder.record_exception(e)
        raise
    finally:
        xray_recorder.end_subsegment()
```

## Best Practices
- Generate sufficient requests in the application to populate X-Ray traces.
- Use the **Service Map** to understand service dependencies and interactions.
- Filter traces by specific nodes or time ranges to focus on relevant requests.
- Monitor **response times** and **error indicators** (e.g., yellow/red circles) to identify performance issues.
- Use trace details to debug bottlenecks or failures by analyzing request durations and paths.


# Integrating AWS X-Ray with Other AWS Services Notes

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Integrate AWS X-Ray with a serverless API backend (API Gateway and Lambda) to trace requests and identify errors.
- **Objective**: Enable X-Ray tracing for API Gateway and Lambda, generate requests, and analyze failures using the X-Ray service map and traces.

## Steps to Integrate X-Ray with AWS Services
1. **Enable X-Ray for API Gateway**:
   - Navigate to **API Gateway Console** > Select the API (e.g., `CloudWatch API`).
   - Go to **Stages** > Select the stage (e.g., `production`).
   - Under **Logs and Tracing**, enable **X-Ray Tracing**.
   - Save changes.
2. **Enable X-Ray for Lambda Function**:
   - Navigate to **Lambda Console** > Select the function (e.g., `CloudWatchAPI-putitemFunction`).
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Monitoring and Operations Tools** > **Edit**.
   - Enable **Active Tracing** for X-Ray.
   - Save changes.
3. **Generate Requests**:
   - Use the API tester tool (from exercise files) to send requests (e.g., 1000 requests, with one failing every three).
   - This simulates traffic to generate traceable data for X-Ray.
4. **Analyze Traces in X-Ray**:
   - Navigate to **CloudWatch Console** > **X-Ray Traces** > **Service Map**.
   - Observe the service map:
     - **Client** → **API Gateway (production stage)** → **Lambda Function**.
     - Visual indicators:
       - **API Gateway**: Red circle (e.g., 35% requests fail with 502 status).
       - **Lambda Function**: Yellow circle (returns 400 errors for invalid payloads).
   - Select **CloudWatch API** > **View Traces**.
   - Filter and open a failed trace (e.g., 502 response).
   - Review trace details:
     - **Flow**: Client → API Gateway → Lambda.
     - **Failure Cause**: Lambda returns non-OK status (e.g., 400 error).
     - **Exception Details**: Navigate to **Exceptions** to see the error (e.g., "One or more parameter values were invalid, missing the key ID in the item").
5. **Troubleshoot and Fix**:
   - Use trace details to identify and resolve the issue (e.g., fix missing `key ID` in the Lambda payload).

## Key Observations
- **Service Map**: Visualizes interactions between Client, API Gateway, and Lambda, highlighting failure rates and statuses.
- **Error Indicators**:
  - **Red Circle**: API Gateway failures (e.g., 502 errors).
  - **Yellow Circle**: Lambda issues (e.g., 400 bad request errors).
- **Trace Details**: Pinpoint the exact cause of failures (e.g., missing parameters), enabling quick debugging.
- **Integration**: X-Ray seamlessly tracks requests across API Gateway and Lambda, simplifying error analysis.

## Example Code Snippet
Below is an example of a Lambda function with X-Ray tracing enabled to capture request details and exceptions:

```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.boto import patch_all
import boto3
import json

# Patch boto3 for X-Ray tracing
patch_all()

@xray_recorder.capture('putitemFunction')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    subsegment = xray_recorder.begin_subsegment('dynamo_operation')
    try:
        dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
        # Example: Validate payload and put item
        if 'key_id' not in event:
            raise ValueError("Missing key ID in the item")
        response = dynamodb.put_item(
            TableName='Items',
            Item={
                'key_id': {'S': event['key_id']},
                'data': {'S': event.get('data', 'default')}
            }
        )
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({'message': 'Item added successfully'})
        }
    except Exception as e:
        xray_recorder.record_exception(e)
        return {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }
    finally:
        xray_recorder.end_subsegment()
```

## Best Practices
- Enable **X-Ray Tracing** for both API Gateway and Lambda to ensure end-to-end request visibility.
- Use the API tester tool to simulate realistic traffic and generate traceable data.
- Monitor the **Service Map** for visual insights into service interactions and error rates.
- Analyze **Trace Details** to identify specific errors (e.g., missing parameters) and their root causes.
- Fix issues based on exception details to improve application reliability.
