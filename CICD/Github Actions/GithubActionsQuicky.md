Here’s a revised version of the GitHub Actions interview preparation questions with concise, straightforward, and impactful answers. All questions remain intact, and code blocks are preserved for clarity where provided. The goal is to make the content digestible without losing depth.

## Basic Concepts

### What are GitHub Actions, and how do they differ from traditional CI/CD tools like Jenkins or CircleCI?
GitHub Actions is a built-in GitHub tool for automating workflows (build, test, deploy) using YAML files triggered by repo events. Unlike Jenkins (standalone, plugin-heavy, flexible) or CircleCI (cloud-focused, orb-based), it’s tightly integrated with GitHub, simpler to set up, and uses a marketplace for reusable actions.

### What is a workflow in GitHub Actions, and how is it defined?
A workflow is an automated process with jobs triggered by events. It’s defined in a YAML file in `.github/workflows`, specifying name, triggers (`on`), and jobs.

### What is the purpose of the `.github/workflows` directory?
It holds all workflow YAML files, acting as the hub for GitHub to find and run automation scripts when events occur.

### What are the key components of a GitHub Actions workflow file?  
- **name**: Workflow label.  
- **on**: Event triggers (e.g., push).  
- **jobs**: Tasks to run, with `runs-on` (runner type) and steps (actions).

### What is an "event" in GitHub Actions, and examples of common ones?
An event triggers a workflow. Examples: `push` (code push), `pull_request` (PR activity), `schedule` (cron-based), `workflow_dispatch` (manual).

### What’s the difference between a "job" and a "step"?
A job is a group of steps running on one runner; steps are individual tasks (e.g., checkout, run script) within a job. Jobs can run in parallel, steps run sequentially.

### What are "actions" in GitHub Actions, and how do you use pre-built ones?
Actions are reusable task units. Pre-built ones from the Marketplace (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`) are used with `uses` in steps:
```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### What’s the role of runners, and what types are available?
Runners execute workflows. Types: GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`) or self-hosted (custom machines).

### How does GitHub Actions handle secrets, and why is it important?
Secrets are encrypted variables (e.g., `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`) set in GitHub Settings. They’re vital to securely handle sensitive data like API keys without exposure.

### What file format is used for workflows, and why?
YAML—readable, simple, and widely used in CI/CD for structured automation.

## Workflow Syntax and Configuration

### How do you specify events to trigger a workflow?
Use `on`:
```yaml
on:
    push:
    pull_request:
    schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'
```

### What does `runs-on` do, and common values?
Sets the runner type. Common: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`, or `self-hosted`.

### How do you define environment variables?
Use `env` at workflow, job, or step level:
```yaml
env:
    GLOBAL: "value"
jobs:
    build:
        env:
            JOB: "job-value"
        steps:
            - env:
                    STEP: "step-value"
                run: echo $STEP
```

### What’s the `if` conditional, and how’s it used?
Controls execution with expressions:
```yaml
steps:
    - if: github.event_name == 'push'
        run: echo "Push only"
```

### How do you set up a matrix strategy?
Run jobs across configs with `strategy.matrix`:
```yaml
jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
            matrix:
                os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
                node: [14, 16]
```

### What’s the `needs` keyword for?
Ensures job dependencies:
```yaml
jobs:
    build:
    deploy:
        needs: build
```

### How do you pass outputs between steps?
Set outputs with `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`:
```yaml
steps:
    - id: step1
        run: echo "output=hello" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    - run: echo ${{ steps.step1.outputs.output }}
```

### What’s the `env` context vs. `github` or `secrets`?
- **env**: Custom variables (`${{ env.VAR }}`).  
- **github**: Event data (`${{ github.sha }}`).  
- **secrets**: Secure data (`${{ secrets.KEY }}`).

### How do you run a workflow on a specific branch or tag?
Filter with `on`:
```yaml
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main
    release:
        tags:
            - 'v*'
```

### What’s `timeout-minutes`, and why use it?
Cancels jobs/steps after a time limit:
```yaml
jobs:
    build:
        timeout-minutes: 10
```
Prevents hangs.

## Practical Use Cases

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - uses: docker/login-action@v3
                with:
                    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
                    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
            - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
                with:

            - run: npm install
            - id: lint
                run: npm run lint -- --output-file eslint-report.txt || echo "LINT_FAILED=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
            - if: env.LINT_FAILED == 'true'
                uses: actions/github-script@v6
                with:
                    script: |
                        const fs = require('fs');
                        const report = fs.readFileSync('eslint-report.txt', 'utf8');
                        github.rest.issues.createComment({
                            issue_number: context.issue.number,
                            owner: context.repo.owner,
                            repo: context.repo.repo,
                            body: `Linting failed:\n\`\`\`\n${report}\n\`\`\``
                        });

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - run: ./my-script.sh
```

### Run only on `.py` file changes?

                    channel-id: 'my-channel'
                    text: 'Workflow ${{ job.status }}!'
```

## Advanced Topics

### What are composite actions, and how to create one?
Composite actions bundle steps into a reusable unit. Create in `.github/actions/my-action/action.yml`:
```yaml
name: 'My Action'
runs:
    using: 'composite'
    steps:
        - run: echo "Step 1"
            shell: bash
        - run: echo "Step 2"
            shell: bash
```
Use: `uses: ./.github/actions/my-action`.

### Reusable workflow and how to call it?
Define in `.github/workflows/reusable.yml`:
```yaml
on:
    workflow_call:
        inputs:
            param:
                required: true
jobs:
    run:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - run: echo ${{ inputs.param }}
```
Call:
```yaml
jobs:
    call:
        uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
        with:
            param: "Hello"
```

### GITHUB_TOKEN vs. PAT?
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Auto-generated, repo-scoped, expires after run.  
- **PAT**: User-created, customizable scope, persistent.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Guide

## Debugging a Failing Workflow
- **Steps to debug**: Check logs, add `echo` steps, enable `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`, re-run, or test locally with `act`.

## Optimizing Workflow Performance
- **Tips**:
    - Cache dependencies.
    - Parallelize jobs.
    - Skip steps with `if`.
    - Optimize commands:
        ```yaml
        - uses: actions/cache@v3
            with:
                path: ~/.npm
                key: npm-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
        ```

## 1. Cache Action Use Cases

### Theoretical Notes
The `actions/cache` action in GitHub Actions enables caching of files or directories to speed up workflows by reusing previously downloaded or built dependencies. It works by associating a cache with a unique key, which is checked for a match to restore the cache. If no match is found, a new cache is created for future runs. The cache is scoped to the repository and branch, with optional restoration from parent branches.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Path**: Specifies files or directories to cache (e.g., `~/.m2/repository` for Maven, `node_modules` for npm).
  - **Key**: A unique identifier for the cache, often incorporating dynamic values like file hashes to invalidate the cache when dependencies change.
  - **Restore Keys**: Fallback keys to restore a cache if the primary key doesn’t match.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Caching build tools (Maven, Gradle) to avoid re-downloading dependencies.
  - Caching package managers (npm, Yarn, pip) to speed up installations.
  - Caching compiled artifacts or intermediate build outputs.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use `hashFiles` to generate keys based on dependency files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package-lock.json`) to ensure cache invalidation when dependencies change.
  - Specify multiple paths for complex projects.
  - Use restore keys to fall back to a recent cache if the exact key isn’t found.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Cache Example
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cache Maven dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.m2/repository
            ~/.gradle/caches
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: mvn install
```

**Explanation**: This workflow caches Maven and Gradle dependencies, using a key based on the OS and `pom.xml` hash. The `restore-keys` allows fallback to any Maven cache for the same OS if the exact key isn’t found.

---

## 2. Securing a Workflow

### Theoretical Notes
Securing GitHub Actions workflows is critical to prevent unauthorized access, secret exposure, or malicious code execution. Key practices include minimizing permissions, pinning actions to specific versions, securely managing secrets, and controlling workflow concurrency to avoid race conditions.

- **Limiting Permissions**:
  - The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has default permissions that may be overly broad. Explicitly set permissions to restrict access.
  - Example: Restrict to `contents: read` for read-only workflows.
- **Pinning Actions**:
  - Use specific commit SHAs or tags (e.g., `@v3.0.0`) to avoid running unverified updates to actions.
- **Secure Secrets**:
  - Store sensitive data in encrypted secrets, never in plaintext.
  - Avoid logging secrets by using environment variables carefully.
- **Concurrency Control**:
  - Prevents multiple workflow runs from interfering, especially for deployments.
  - Uses a `group` to identify runs and optionally cancels in-progress runs.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Secure Workflow
on: push
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3.0.0
      - name: Deploy with secret
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

**Explanation**: This workflow restricts `GITHUB_TOKEN` to read contents and write issues, pins the `checkout` action to a specific version, uses a secret securely, and ensures only one run per branch executes at a time.

---

## 3. Permissions Key

### Theoretical Notes
The `permissions` key in a workflow or job defines the scope of the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is an automatically generated token for interacting with GitHub APIs. By default, the token has broad permissions, which can pose security risks. Explicitly setting permissions follows the principle of least privilege.

- **Common Permissions**:
  - `contents: read/write` for repository access.
  - `issues: read/write` for issue management.
  - `pull-requests: write` for PR comments or labels.
- **Scope**:
  - Workflow-level permissions apply to all jobs.
  - Job-level permissions override workflow-level for that job.
- **Use Case**:
  - Restrict workflows that only need to read code or post comments.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Comment on Issue
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write
jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              body: 'Thank you for opening this issue!'
            })
```

**Explanation**: This workflow only needs to write to issues, so permissions are restricted accordingly, reducing the risk of unintended repository modifications.

---

## 4. Self-Hosted Runners

### Theoretical Notes
Self-hosted runners are custom machines you manage to run GitHub Actions workflows, as opposed to GitHub-hosted runners. They’re ideal for workflows requiring specific hardware, internal network access, or custom environments.

- **Setup**:
  - Configure in repository Settings > Actions > Runners.
  - Install the runner application on your machine and register it with GitHub.
- **Pros**:
  - Full control over hardware, OS, and software.
  - Access to internal resources (e.g., private registries).
  - Cost-effective for high usage.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires maintenance (updates, scaling).
  - No GitHub support for runner issues.
  - Security responsibility falls on you.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use ephemeral runners (one-time use) for security.
  - Monitor runner status and logs.
  - Restrict runner access with labels.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Self-Hosted Workflow
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run on custom environment
        run: |
          echo "Running on $(uname -a)"
          ./build.sh
```

**Explanation**: This workflow runs on a self-hosted runner, leveraging a custom environment for building. The `runs-on: self-hosted` label targets the runner.

---

## 5. Handling Long-Running Workflows

### Theoretical Notes
Long-running workflows can hit GitHub’s default timeouts (6 hours for GitHub-hosted runners) or resource limits. Strategies to manage them include increasing timeouts, splitting jobs, optimizing steps, or using self-hosted runners for more control.

- **Timeout Settings**:
  - Set `timeout-minutes` at the job or step level to allow longer execution.
- **Job Splitting**:
  - Break workflows into smaller, parallel jobs to reduce individual run times.
- **Optimization**:
  - Cache dependencies, parallelize tasks, or skip unnecessary steps.
- **Self-Hosted Runners**:
  - Avoid GitHub’s timeout limits by hosting your own runners.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Long-Running Workflow
on: push
jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 720
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.m2/repository
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('pom.xml') }}
      - name: Run long task
        run: ./long-running-script.sh
```

**Explanation**: This workflow sets a 12-hour timeout and caches dependencies to optimize a long-running task.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Edge Cases

### Theoretical Notes
GitHub Actions workflows can encounter issues like runner unavailability, network failures, permission errors, or unexpected behavior. Systematic troubleshooting involves checking logs, validating configurations, and implementing retries or fallbacks.

- **Common Issues**:
  - **No Runner Available**: Incorrect `runs-on` label or offline self-hosted runners.
  - **Network Failures**: External services may be down or unstable.
  - **Permission Errors**: Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` scopes.
  - **Concurrency Conflicts**: Multiple runs triggered simultaneously.
  - **Skipped Workflows**: Commit messages with `[skip ci]` or conditional `if` clauses.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Enable debug logging (`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true`).
  - Add retries for flaky steps.
  - Use `continue-on-error` for non-critical steps.
  - Rotate exposed secrets immediately.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Robust Workflow
on: push
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Retry network call
        continue-on-error: true
        run: |
          for i in {1..3}; do curl http://example.com && break || sleep 5; done
      - name: Debug output
        if: failure()
        run: echo "Previous step failed, check logs"
      - name: Use secret securely
        env:
          SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
        run: ./script.sh
```

**Explanation**: This workflow handles network failures with retries, uses `continue-on-error` for optional steps, debugs failures, and securely uses secrets.

---

## 7. Continue-on-Error

### Theoretical Notes
The `continue-on-error` property allows a step to fail without failing the entire job, useful for optional or non-critical tasks. It’s often used with flaky external services or steps where partial failure is acceptable.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Notifications to external services that may be down.
  - Optional linting or analysis steps.
  - Steps that collect metrics but aren’t critical to deployment.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Combine with `if: failure()` to handle errors gracefully.
  - Avoid overusing, as it can mask real issues.

### Code Snippet
```yaml
name: Continue-on-Error Example
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Optional step
        continue-on-error: true
        run: curl http://optional-service.com
      - name: Log if failed
        if: failure()
        run: echo "Optional step failed, continuing"
      - name: Critical step
        run: ./build.sh
```

**Explanation**: The optional curl step can fail without stopping the workflow, and a follow-up step logs the failure if it occurs.

---

## 1. Testing Workflow Locally
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Testing GitHub Actions workflows locally reduces the feedback loop during development, saving time and CI resources. Tools like `act` simulate the GitHub Actions environment on your machine.
- **How `act` Works**: `act` reads your workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/my-workflow.yml`) and executes it in a Docker container mimicking GitHub’s runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`). It supports most Actions but may have limitations with custom or complex actions due to environment differences.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`) aren’t available locally, so you may need to mock them using environment variables or a `.env` file.
  - Ensure Docker is installed, as `act` relies on it.
  - Use the `-P` flag to specify a runner image (e.g., `-P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`) for compatibility.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Test specific jobs with `act -j job-name`.
  - Use `--secret-file` to provide secrets securely.
  - Validate locally before pushing to avoid CI failures.

**Code Snippet**:
```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # On macOS, or use other package managers

# Run a specific workflow locally
act -W .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml -j build

# Mock secrets using a .env file
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=fake-token" > .env
act -W .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml --secret-file .env

# Run with a specific runner image
act -W .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml -P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
```

## 2. Integration and Ecosystem
### a. GitHub Packages Integration
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: GitHub Packages is a package registry for publishing and consuming packages (e.g., npm, Docker) within GitHub’s ecosystem. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for automated publishing.
- **Authentication**: Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication, which is scoped to the repository and automatically provided by GitHub Actions.
- **Use Cases**: Publish private or public npm packages, Docker images, or Maven artifacts.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Ensure the `registry-url` matches the package type (e.g., `https://npm.pkg.github.com` for npm).
  - Update `.npmrc` or equivalent configuration files to point to GitHub Packages.
  - Public packages require the repository to be public, or you’ll face permission issues.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use scoped packages (e.g., `@owner/package-name`) to avoid naming conflicts.
  - Cache dependencies to speed up workflows.
  - Rotate `GITHUB_TOKEN` if it’s compromised (handled automatically by GitHub).

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Publish to GitHub Packages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Add a `.npmrc` file in your repository:
  ```text
  @owner:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
  ```
- For private packages, ensure the repository has appropriate permissions.

### b. Deploy to GitHub Pages
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: GitHub Pages hosts static websites directly from a repository, and Actions automates the deployment process.
- **Workflow Breakdown**:
  - `actions/checkout`: Clones the repository.
  - `npm run build`: Builds the static site (e.g., using Vite, Hugo, or Jekyll).
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact`: Uploads the build output as a Pages artifact.
  - `actions/deploy-pages`: Deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages.
- **Permissions**: Requires `pages: write` and `id-token: write` to interact with Pages and authenticate the deployment.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Ensure the repository is configured for GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages > Source).
  - The `path` in `upload-pages-artifact` must match the build output directory.
  - For single-page apps, configure a `404.html` or routing rules.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use a custom domain for branding.
  - Cache build dependencies to reduce deployment time.
  - Test the site locally before deploying.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Add a `vite.config.js` for a Vite project to set the base URL:
  ```javascript
  export default {
    base: '/repository-name/',
  };
  ```

### c. Work with Terraform
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform in a CI/CD pipeline.
- **How It Works**:
  - `hashicorp/setup-terraform`: Installs Terraform and configures it for use.
  - `terraform init`: Initializes the working directory.
  - `terraform apply`: Applies the configuration to provision resources.
- **Security**: AWS credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) are stored as GitHub Secrets to prevent exposure.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Use a backend (e.g., S3) for state management to avoid conflicts in team environments.
  - Enable `auto-approve` only for non-production environments to prevent accidental changes.
  - Validate Terraform plans before applying (`terraform plan`).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` in CI to enforce code quality.
  - Store state files securely (e.g., in an S3 bucket with encryption).
  - Use workspace or variable files for environment-specific configurations.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with:
          terraform_version: '1.5.0'
      - run: terraform init
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - run: terraform plan -out=tfplan
      - run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example Terraform configuration (`main.tf`):
  ```hcl
  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  }
  ```

## 3. Popular Marketplace Actions
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Marketplace actions are reusable workflows or steps that simplify common tasks.
- **Key Actions**:
  - `actions/checkout`: Clones the repository into the runner. Essential for most workflows.
  - `actions/setup-node`: Configures a Node.js environment with a specified version.
  - `actions/cache`: Caches dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`) to speed up workflows.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces boilerplate code.
  - Maintained by the community or GitHub, ensuring reliability.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Pin action versions (e.g., `@v4`) to avoid breaking changes.
  - Review action source code for security, especially for lesser-known actions.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use official actions when possible (e.g., `actions/*`).
  - Combine `cache` with setup actions for optimal performance.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Build and Test
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

---

## 4. Enforcing Code Quality
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Automated code quality checks (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) ensure consistency and catch issues early.
- **Workflow Trigger**: Typically runs on `pull_request` to validate changes before merging.
- **Benefits**:
  - Enforces coding standards across teams.
  - Reduces technical debt by catching issues in CI.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Configure linters to fail the workflow on errors (e.g., `npx eslint . --max-warnings=0`).
  - Use `fix` commands (e.g., `eslint --fix`) in local development, not CI.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Integrate with PR status checks to block merges on failures.
  - Cache dependencies to speed up linting.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Lint Code
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx eslint . --max-warnings=0
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example `.eslintrc.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "env": { "node": true, "es2021": true },
    "extends": ["eslint:recommended"],
    "rules": { "no-unused-vars": "error" }
  }
  ```

---

## 5. Multi-Language Support
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Support projects with multiple languages (e.g., Node.js and Python) in a single workflow.
- **How It Works**:
  - Use setup actions (`setup-node`, `setup-python`) to configure language environments.
  - Run language-specific commands (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`).
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Ensure runners support all languages (e.g., `ubuntu-latest` is versatile).
  - Cache dependencies for each language to optimize performance.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Split jobs by language for parallel execution if the project is large.
  - Use matrix builds for testing across multiple versions.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Test Multi-Language Project
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install pytest
      - run: pytest
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example matrix build for multiple versions:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          node-version: ['18', '20']
          python-version: ['3.9', '3.11']
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        - run: npm test
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
          with:
            python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        - run: pytest
  ```

---

## 6. Monorepo Setup
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Monorepos host multiple projects in a single repository (e.g., `packages/app`, `packages/api`). Actions can target specific paths to optimize workflows.
- **Path Filters**: The `paths` filter triggers workflows only when specified directories change.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces unnecessary CI runs for unaffected projects.
  - Simplifies dependency management.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Use `paths-ignore` for exclusions if needed.
  - Ensure `actions/checkout` fetches the correct depth for path-based triggers.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use workspace files (e.g., `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) for monorepo tools like pnpm.
  - Cache dependencies per package to avoid redundant installs.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Test Monorepo App
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'packages/app/**'
jobs:
  app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install -g pnpm
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: cd packages/app && pnpm test
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  packages:
    - 'packages/app'
    - 'packages/api'
  ```

---

## 7. Dependabot Integration
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Dependabot automates dependency updates by creating PRs. Actions can validate these PRs to ensure updates don’t break the project.
- **Conditional Trigger**: The `if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'` condition runs the job only for Dependabot PRs.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures dependency updates are tested before merging.
  - Reduces manual review effort.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Configure `.github/dependabot.yml` to specify update schedules and ecosystems.
  - Use Dependabot’s version compatibility checks to minimize failures.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Combine with code quality checks (e.g., linting, tests).
  - Auto-merge passing PRs using GitHub’s auto-merge feature.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: Test Dependabot PRs
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example `.github/dependabot.yml`:
  ```yaml
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: npm
      directory: /
      schedule:
        interval: weekly
  ```

---

## 8. Code/Secret Scanning
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: Tools like CodeQL analyze code for vulnerabilities and secrets (e.g., exposed API keys).
- **How CodeQL Works**:
  - Scans codebases for patterns (e.g., SQL injection, hard-coded credentials).
  - Supports multiple languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java).
- **Benefits**:
  - Integrates with GitHub’s security tab for centralized reporting.
  - Catches issues early in the development cycle.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Requires setup for each language (e.g., specify `language: javascript`).
  - May produce false positives; review results manually.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Run on `push` and `pull_request` for continuous monitoring.
  - Use custom queries for project-specific vulnerabilities.

**Code Snippet**:
```yaml
name: CodeQL Analysis
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: javascript
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

---

## 9. Open-Source Role
**Theoretical Notes:**
- **Purpose**: GitHub Actions streamlines open-source contributions by automating testing, PR validation, and release processes.
- **Key Workflows**:
  - **Testing**: Run unit/integration tests on PRs to ensure code quality.
  - **PR Validation**: Enforce linting, formatting, and security checks.
  - **Releases**: Automate versioning and publishing (e.g., to npm, PyPI).
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces maintainer overhead.
  - Encourages contributions by providing clear feedback.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Use branch protection rules to enforce workflow checks.
  - Provide clear `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines for contributors.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use labels to trigger specific workflows (e.g., `release` for publishing).
  - Communicate CI results clearly in PR comments.

**Code Snippet** (Automated Release):
```yaml
name: Release Package
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Additional Notes**:
- Example `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Contributing
  1. Fork the repository.
  2. Run `npm install` and `npm test`.
  3. Submit a PR with clear descriptions.
  4. Ensure CI passes (linting, tests, CodeQL).
  ```

---

## Additional Best Practices and Tips
1. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Use `actions/cache` for dependencies and build artifacts.
   - Run jobs in parallel when possible (e.g., matrix builds).
2. **Security**:
   - Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets.
   - Use Dependabot and CodeQL for proactive security.
3. **Debugging**:
   - Enable debug logs in workflows (`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true`).
   - Use `act` for local testing to catch issues early.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Document workflows in a `README.md` or `docs/ci.md`.
   - Explain setup steps for contributors.

**Example Debugging Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Debug Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  debug:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Debugging enabled" && ls -la
        env:
          ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## Scenario-Based Questions
- **Speed up a 20-min workflow**: Cache, parallelize, skip steps:
    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
            path: ~/.npm
            key: npm-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
    ```
- **Secret committed**: Remove from history, rotate, use `env`:
    ```yaml
    - run: deploy.sh
        env:
            API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    ```
- **PR vs. push steps**:
    ```yaml
    steps:
        - if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
            run: npm test
        - if: github.event_name == 'push'
            run: npm run deploy
    ```
- **Deprecated action**: Update to newer version or replicate manually:
    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    ```
- **Deploy after tests**:
    ```yaml
    jobs:
        test:
            steps:
                - run: npm test
        deploy:
            needs: test
            steps:
                - run: npm run deploy
    ```
- **Auto-bump version**:
    ```yaml
    on: workflow_dispatch
    jobs:
        release:
            steps:
                - run: npm version patch && git push --follow-tags
                - uses: actions/create-release@v1
                    env:
                        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```
- **Jenkins to GitHub Actions challenges**: YAML learning, runner setup, plugin migration, cost for private repos.
- **PR tests before merge**: Workflow + branch protection:
    ```yaml
    on: pull_request
    jobs:
        test:
            steps:
                - run: npm test
    ```
- **Multi-stage deployment**:
    ```yaml
    jobs:
        test:
            steps:
                - run: npm test
        deploy-dev:
            needs: test
            if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev'
            steps:
                - run: echo "Deploy dev"
    ```
- **Windows + Linux compatibility**:
    ```yaml
    strategy:
        matrix:
            os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
        - run: echo "Cross-platform"
            shell: bash
    ```
