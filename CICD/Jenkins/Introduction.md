  - Jenkins 2.332.1
- **Notes**:
  - Course content is periodically reviewed and updated for compatibility with newer software versions.
  - Check the courseâ€™s Q&A section and exercise files for version discrepancy information.

## Example Code Snippet
Below is an example of a basic Jenkins pipeline configuration as code, typically stored in a `Jenkinsfile` in a GitHub repository:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                // Add build commands here, e.g., sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                // Add test commands here, e.g., sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production...'
                // Add deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: This `Jenkinsfile` defines a simple pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. It uses Groovy syntax and can be stored in a GitHub repository for version control and automation.

## Additional Notes
- **Distributed Builds**: Learn how to scale Jenkins using distributed builds to handle large projects efficiently.
- **Artifact Management**: Understand how to manage build artifacts for traceability and deployment.
- **Security**: Explore best practices for securing Jenkins instances to protect pipelines and sensitive data.
- **Resources**: Use the exercise files repository for hands-on practice and refer to LinkedIn Learning for supplementary Git and Linux courses.
